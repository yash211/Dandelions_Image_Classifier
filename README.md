# Dandelions_Image_Classifier

Dandelions image classifier is the model used to build to predict whether the image contains dandelions(grass) or not.The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gcdatkin/dandelion-image-classification/data).For these model i had used 500 images as my final dataset.To learn more about deep learning methods comprising of neural network,Convulation neural network,etc was the purpose to build these project.I had used convulation neural network with 5 hidden layers with adam optimizer and binarycross entropy as the loss function.
